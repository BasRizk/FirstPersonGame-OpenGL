**First Person Player - OpenGL**

First person shooter game implemented fully using OpenGL API in C++, as part of the coursework of "Computer Graphics" course, taught by the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in the German University in Cairo.

Simplistic in the sense to be implemented in such a short duration, however, includes 3d game mechanics, two environments, texturing, sounds, enimies, and ammo filling; basically a complete gaming experience.
